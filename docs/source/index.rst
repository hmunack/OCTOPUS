**OCTOPUS** (`https://octopusdata.org <https://octopusdata.org>`_) is an Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) compliant web-enabled database that allows users to visualise, query, and download cosmogenic 10Be and 26Al, luminescence, and radiocarbon ages and denudation rates associated with erosional landscapes, Quaternary depositional landforms and archaeological records, along with associated geospatial (vector and raster) data layers.

**Acknowledgement**. OCTOPUS database is supported by the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Australian Biodiversity and Heritage (CABAH) [#]_. Funding was also provided by the University of Wollongong [#]_ and the Australian National Data Service (ANDS), now part of the Australian Research Data Commons [#]_.
